# Sign-Language-Detection
Developed a real-time sign language detection system using an ESP32-CAM for live hand tracking.
The ESP32-CAM was programmed in Embedded C using Arduino IDE to stream live photo frames.  
Implemented hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe in Python, processing frames from the ESP32-CAMâ€™s camera server.
Hand gestures were mapped to predefined sign language symbols for accurate detection.
